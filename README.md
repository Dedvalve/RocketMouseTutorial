# RocketMouseTutorial
To get a better grasp of coding I took a C# tutorial and manually translated everything to Unityscript. 

Here is a link to the tutorial I took written in C# http://www.raywenderlich.com/69392/make-game-like-jetpack-joyride-unity-2d-part-1

This tutorial is really good at covering everything but translating to another language really forced me to not only get a better understanding of both languages but made sure I wasn't just copy/pasting code and was understanding what I was writing.
